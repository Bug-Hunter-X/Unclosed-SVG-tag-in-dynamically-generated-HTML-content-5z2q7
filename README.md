# Unclosed SVG Tag in Dynamically Generated HTML
This repository demonstrates a common HTML error: an improperly nested or unclosed SVG element within dynamically generated content.  The bug involves adding HTML (including an SVG) to the DOM using innerHTML.  The solution shows how to address the problem.

**Problem:**  In the `bug.html` file, an SVG circle is added to a paragraph via `innerHTML`. However, improper nesting or an unclosed tag might cause the browser to misinterpret the HTML structure and lead to rendering errors or validation failures. 

**Solution:** The `solution.html` provides a corrected approach using `document.createElement` for creating and appending SVG elements, ensuring proper structure and avoiding the potential issues associated with direct `innerHTML` manipulation for complex HTML structures.

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
2. Observe potential layout issues or browser console errors indicating invalid HTML. 

## How to view the solution

1. Open `solution.html` in a web browser.
2. Observe the correctly rendered SVG circle inside the paragraph.  The solution avoids direct `innerHTML` manipulation for complex elements, ensuring correct HTML structure.
